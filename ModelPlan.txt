Create an object ETFPoint with attribute, closing date and price
- DateTime closingDate;
- Double price

Create an object ETFCurve with these attributes, curve name and an array that stores prices,
- curveIdentity
- ArrayList<ETFPoint> curveData;
- curve Gradient
- curve standard deviation

Create ETFCurves with one attribute, an array that stores array
- ArrayList<ETFCurve> curves

TODO - NEXT
- * Todo - using java show only one graph and calculate the trend and variation and put it next to the graph
- * Todo - create multiple graphs, one for each fund and put them next to each other
- * Todo - sort the graphs by the most positive trends and variation
- Todo - find another way to find the most positive graph, gradient and variations are not enough
- Todo - create a resful api, package, and deploy using wildlfy
- Todo - check if you can host the application online so it runs everytime to monitor the data
